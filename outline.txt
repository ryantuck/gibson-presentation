lots of departments
lots of data
how do we deal with it?
lots of tools * BQ
excel!
spreadsheets are really handy
but there's a problem
excel crashing
how do we fix that?
use better tools for the job - SQL etc plus training
but we can't change everything overnight
so let's throw compute at it
we don't have a supercomputer but we do have the cloud
to AWS
we spun up a big ol machine and finance could run big workbooks!
but then a bunch of other people got logins
and we ended up with a mainframe
so we could either crank up the existing machine again, or
new idea, inspired by autoscaling / serverless stuff
let's give everyone a supercomputer
but what about $$$
they'll be off most of the time
where's the on button? don't want people monkeying around in AWS.
chatbot!
provision with boto3, ec2, ELB, route53
hook up AD with ansible (gross)
gibson bot - use lambda with api gateway
apex deploy
gibson start
gibson stop
gibson status
POST body
handling in python
boto3 stuff
handling edge cases
gibson open the pod bay doors :)
but people were forgetting to shut them off!
let's get heuristics for when a machine is idle and kill it
this turns out to be a combination of network activity and CPU
manage instance code
gibson room stats
still training, assisting with automation where we can.
but don't do this because appstream 2.0 exists and we're looking into switching to that!
btw spectacle is really cool.
